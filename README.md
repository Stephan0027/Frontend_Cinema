# FRONTEND_CINEMA
Assignment 2 of frontend course

# Background
This repository contains a basic website to explore and learn the functionality of the react framework. The goal was to create a website for a cinema. The page needed to show all the movies that were playing and state some basic information about each movie. 

Some basic features needed to be implemented to get a feeling for the useState concepts and other specific react features. A visitor can:
```
> select a movie to view details
> filter screenings by category or day
> select tickets
> select seats
> make a booking and receive a summary of his choices
> view the webpage on different screens
```
